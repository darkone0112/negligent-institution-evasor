# 🔥 Negligent Institution Evasor  
## Automating what should never have needed automation
**Because Spain’s Extranjería made it clear they don’t give a damn — so we automated their job.**

If you’ve tried booking a NIE appointment online, you already know:  
It’s not just broken — it’s **hostile by design**.

The official site is a Kafkaesque hellloop of dropdowns, captchas, and fake availability.  
It gaslights you with “No appointments available” 24/7, then magically offers dozens to shady resellers and bots.

This isn’t bad code.  
This is **systemic negligence wrapped in HTML**.  
A digital middle finger to every foreigner trying to do things legally.

So we said **fuck that**, and wrote a bot.

## 🤖 What this does

- Clicks through the portal like a tired, desperate human would  
- Picks your province, office, and trámite  
- Waits like a person. Scrolls like a person. Doesn’t crash like the site.  
- Alerts you the second something shows up  
- Leaves no trace. No spam. Just justice.

---

## 💢 Why this matters

Because people lose jobs, visas, and peace of mind because **a public institution refused to do the bare minimum**.

Because the only people who get appointments are:  
1. Lucky  
2. Rich  
3. Using bots  

Let’s make sure the third one isn’t exclusive to mafias.

## 🚫 What this isn’t

- It’s not a scam.  
- It’s not for sale.  
- It’s not polite.

This is a **code-based middle finger** to a broken system that abandoned the people it’s supposed to serve.

## ⚠️ Final note

This project is a **protest**.  
Use it with respect. Don’t scalp appointments. Don’t profit from others' desperation.  
This is here so **you don’t get steamrolled by indifference**.

If they ever fix the system, we’ll gladly shut this down. But let’s be honest…  
They won’t.
